​The CBSE Class 1 Mathematics syllabus covers a wide range of topics, including numbers, shapes, space, time, measurement, data handling, and patterns. The goal of the syllabus is to provide students with a solid foundation in basic mathematics concepts that they can use in their future studies and in their everyday lives.

Numbers

In Class 1, students will learn about numbers from 1 to 99. They will learn how to read, write, and compare numbers; how to add and subtract numbers; and how to use numbers in real-world situations.

Shapes

Students will learn about different shapes, including squares, triangles, circles, and rectangles. They will learn how to identify shapes, how to draw shapes, and how to measure the sides of shapes.

Space

Students will learn about different concepts related to space, such as 2D and 3D shapes, position, and movement. They will learn how to describe the location of objects in space, how to move objects around in space, and how to measure the distance between objects.

Time

Students will learn about different units of time, such as seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years. They will learn how to tell time, how to measure time intervals, and how to use time in real-world situations.

Measurement

Students will learn about different units of measurement, such as length, weight, capacity, and temperature. They will learn how to measure objects, how to compare the size of objects, and how to use measurement in real-world situations.

Data Handling

Students will learn about different ways to collect and organize data. They will learn how to create charts and graphs, how to interpret data, and how to use data to make decisions.

Patterns

Students will learn about different types of patterns, such as number patterns, shape patterns, and word patterns. They will learn how to recognize patterns, how to create patterns, and how to use patterns in real-world situations.

The CBSE Class 1 Mathematics syllabus is designed to be engaging and interactive. Students will learn through a variety of activities, such as games, songs, and puzzles. They will also have the opportunity to apply their knowledge to real-world situations.

The syllabus is also designed to be challenging. Students will be expected to think critically and solve problems. They will also be expected to communicate their mathematical ideas clearly and effectively.

The CBSE Class 1 Mathematics syllabus is a comprehensive and rigorous curriculum that will prepare students for success in mathematics and in their future studies.​​
